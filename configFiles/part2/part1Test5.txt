# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# This config file format is intended for use with
# Part1Test.java.

# NOTE: the GUI is not used for part 1 testing.

# NOTE: PLAYERS is not used in PART 1 config file.  The player
# to be tested is instead provided via a command line argument
# when running the program.  Also, TIMELIMIT is not specified
# in this config file, but internally a 10 second limit
# is used to limit the allowed computation by the player
# for any method call (this should not be an issue).

# PART must be present with value 1 to indicate that this
# config file is appropriate for PART 1 testing
PART 1

# DIM is used to indicate the size of the smaller dimension
# of the grid of nodes for each player.
# It must have an integer value in the range 3-20.
# The larger dimension always has value DIM+1.
# Both players nodes can be placed on an overall grid of
# size (2*DIM+1) by (2*DIM+1).
# DIM has a default value of 6 if it is not specified in
# the configuration file.
DIM 3

# a PREMOVE is used to get the game started with
# a specific move before calling the
# HUMAN / player modules for moves.
# a PREMOVE must have three comma-separated values,
# with no spaces, indicating row, column and player id
# for the move.
# Multiple PREMOVE lines are allowed, and are processed in order.
# An invalid PREMOVE will cause a game error.
# PREMOVE lines are optional.
PREMOVE 1,1,1
PREMOVE 1,3,2
PREMOVE 2,2,1
PREMOVE 3,5,2
PREMOVE 2,4,1
PREMOVE 3,3,2
PREMOVE 4,2,1
PREMOVE 5,3,2

# RESULT for part 1 contains two comma separated boolean
# values (no spaces allowed before or after the comma).
# These are groundtruth values for this test indicating
# whether player 1 or 2 respectively has won the game.
# The player module output will be compared against
# these ground truth values.
RESULT false,true
